# @dorinbotan/storybook-router

**Note: Forked from [Gianni Valdambrini](https://github.com/gvaldambrini/storybook-router) who unfortunately stopped maintaining this project 3 years ago.**

A [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) decorator that allows you to use your routing-aware components. You can simply use the library _link_ component within your story or you can write a real prototype of your application using `StoryRouter` in conjunction with the [story links addon](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/links).

The decorator currently supports [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) v4 / v5 and [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/) v2 / v3.

For more information, please refer to the specific documentation for [using with react-router](https://github.com/dorinbotan/storybook-router/tree/master/packages/react) or [using with vue-router](https://github.com/dorinbotan/storybook-router/tree/master/packages/vue).
